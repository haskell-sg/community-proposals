# Haskell Community Project

## Motivation
In the past two years we have been sticking to the form of inviting speakers to talk. However, we feel that this form exhausted organizers and active participants, since it is mostly giving and most of time it is just to fulfill the responsibilities. It's time to try out new way of community development. We would list a few of projects from top of our heads, it might be the projects that have been our wish list for a long time, or it is just a grandiose project that we would want to conquer and learn something along the way. We want it to be a journey to the epiphany where everybody would learn something along the way. Even you are a completely new comers, we welcome you and would manage to find tasks matching your proficiency. 


## Participate

* Everyone willing to learn Haskell, we would give proper guidance if you have no previous experience on Haskell. 
* The only condition is that we might invite you to give a talk on your finding.


## Code Review

* For most of the tasks the active participants could help review them. For advanced task we would invite the domain expert to see if they are willing to help and give us guidancce.
