# Periscope Clone

## Motivation
* It would be quite handy if we have a SQL to Visulization tool.
* Haskell to Visualization might also work, since Gabriel Gonzalez mentioned about [Haskell and Spreadsheet](http://www.haskellforall.com/2014/06/spreadsheet-like-programming-in-haskell.html)
* There are already [Periscope](https://www.periscopedata.com/) or Tableau in the market.
* Support cross datastore join.
* Once we have this tool, it could be a no brainer to set it up as long as you have BI need.

## Goal
* A (Haskell or SQL) to Visualization tool.
* Single data store operation.
* It supports DSL to do cross data store join, like Haxl.


## Skills learned
* GHCJS
* Building Website with haskell web framework.
* Parsing with Haskell
